  ## sup
  im zedion, as seen in my username of course.
  ## What i do, that i enjoy
  i regularly play minecraft, if i really want too, aswell for other games in which i have zero skills at.
  ## What i plan on making
  anything, i work on random projects/repositorys/games, mostly HTML, JS, CSS, pretty much alot of languages.
  i dont plan nor promise to make good stuff.
  i have no ego, i most definently do not think that im better than someone else, or that they cant be better than me.
  ## Thanks for reading, if you did read
  always wishing people an happy day (maybe), and that they wont get a bug in their code.
